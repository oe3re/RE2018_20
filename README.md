Coffee machine


Idea of this project is to design a coffee machine that you usually see on a college hallway. Machine must demonstrate the following functionalities: list of all the available hot beverages, sugar level, current credit amount and, if applicable, change. Wanted beverage is selected by pressing a number, and if alongside a number a sign is entered, either + or â€“ (in combination as 1+, 1-), more or less beverages of the same kind are ordered. One can order more beverages at once. Preparation of every beverage takes 2s. Sugar is set by pressing + or -. Keep in mind that no counter can be set to zero by incrementing. If there are not enough funds, display message and freeze the order. On the change sector display the remaining change after all the drinks are made.
